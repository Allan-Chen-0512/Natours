PROJECT GOALS:

The goal of this project was to practice my skills and understanding in how advanced CSS works behind the scenes ( such as the Visual Formatting Model ). This project also focuses on SASS, the CSS architecture, CSS components, BEM, Browser Support and Responsive Images, by building a responsive webpage about tours and its details using vanilla CSS and HTML.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This project uses simple technologies in the frontend such as CSS3, HTML5, Sass to create a complex responsive webpage that lays out all necessary sections ( such as features, stories, pricing plans, about etc.) for the Natours Website and is optimized for user experience and efficiency.

This project is implemented with using Three Pillars of Good Web Design and it uses a 7-1 CSS Architecture. This project also uses vanilla CSS & HTML to implement a custom grid system.
